## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

First of all, I challenged myself to make my own slider, that was hard and fun at the same time. Fortunately, I ended up creating a reusable slider for my own that can scale perfectly to other needs.

I learned the hard lesson of underpreparing for the challenge when creating elements, in this case I stumbled upon the fact that I needed to create extra elements within the image previews of the slider to be able to generate the focused and hover effects of an opacity with a white background.

### Continued development

I will focus on my preparation for the next projects.

As I progress in the learning process, I'm sure I will find a more efficient way to rebuild that slider.
